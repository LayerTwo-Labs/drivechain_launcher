# Drivechain Launcher

ðŸš§ Under construction

This application is built using [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot).

Godot may seem like an odd choice at first glance, but with its cross-platform
abilities and an amazing set of GUI & IO features, it makes it very capable for
this application.

We can currently run on Mac, Windows, and Linux.

If you'd like to build from source, check below.

## Development Environment Prerequisites

- Godot 4.1.1 [Download Page](https://godotengine.org/download)

Currently only scripted in GDScript, but we could use the .NET version of Godot
which brings C# support.

Once you've gotten your development environment set up:

- Clone repo
- Open the project and run

### Important

The app relies on external binaries to be downloaded from a specific GitHub
release. This is a bit cumbersome, but was the best we could come up with for
now.

- chain_providers.cfg are where each of the sidechain configs starts. The hash
  and file size for each platform binary is manually generated and added to the
  config for the release if it has changed.
- version.cfg is where you would update the version and base GitHub release URL.
  Sometimes you may need to create a pre-release, upload all the binaries there
  and point to that as you are developing.
- Currently, each platform version is built on its respective platform. So build
  the launcher for Linux on Linux, Mac on Mac, and Windows on Windows.
- Mac is a bit different as you need to have a developer ID certificate so that
  Godot can request a signature and notarization. Whoever does this will need to
  create a signing certificate request and have Paul then create a new developer
  ID certificate with that request. Then you would install that into your Mac
  keychain. More info here:
